* [Issue tracking](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/browse/OCSDK)
 
To use the SDK, you will also need to:
* Obtain a copy of the [IAR toolchain] (http://www.iar.com/en/Products/IAR-Embedded-Workbench/ARM/) - the kickstart addition will not work with the OCSDK
* Have a supported [manager and mote] (https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OCSDK/Required+Hardware) and optional programming/debugging tools
* Get the library files from Linear. The SmartMesh library is **not** included in the On-Chip SDK repository, but is available 
from your personal downloads page. Contact your local [Linear sales office](http://www.linear.com/contact) to get access to 
a personal downloads page.
* Read the OCSDK [Documentation](https://dustcloud.atlassian.net/wiki/display/OCSDK) and the API documentation in the /doc folder
